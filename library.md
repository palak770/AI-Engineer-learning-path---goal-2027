# Python Libraries - Detailed Guide

## What is a Python Library?

A **Python library** is a collection of pre-written code (modules, functions, classes) that you can use to perform specific tasks without writing the code from scratch.  
Libraries provide ready-made tools that help you solve problems efficiently and follow best practices.

## Why Use Python Libraries?

- **Save Time:** No need to reinvent the wheel. Libraries provide tested and optimized code.
- **Increase Productivity:** Focus on solving your specific problem rather than low-level details.
- **Access Advanced Features:** Use complex algorithms, data structures, or utilities without deep knowledge.
- **Community Support:** Most libraries are open source, actively maintained, and well documented.

## How to Install Python Libraries

Python libraries are usually hosted on the **Python Package Index (PyPI)** and can be installed using the Python package manager called **pip**.

### Installing a library with pip:
