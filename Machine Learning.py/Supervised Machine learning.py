"""                                               Supervised Learning 
supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled dataâ€”meaning each input is paired with the correct output.
the model learns by comparing its predictions with the actual answers provided in the training data.
Over time, it adjusts itself to minimize errors and improve accuracy. 
The goal of supervised learning is to make accurate predictions when given new, unseen data
"""

#Supervised machine learning involves training a model on labeled data to learn patterns and relationships, which it then uses to make accurate predictions on new data.

"""                                       it includes 
1. Training phase( algo): involves feeding the algorithm labeled data, where each data point is paired with its correct output.
  The algorithm learns to identify patterns and relationships between the input and output data.

2. Testing phase (logic): involves feeding the algorithm new, unseen data and evaluating its ability to predict the correct output based on the learned patterns.

'''                           Types of Supervised Learning in Machine Learning

Classification(defined labels): Where the output is a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails, yes vs. no).
Regression( no defined labels ): Where the output is a continuous variable (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices).

Classification teaches a machine to sort things into categories. It learns by looking at examples with labels (like emails marked "spam" or "not spam").
After learning, it can decide which category new items belong to, like identifying if a new email is spam or not.
